### kobo-drm-in-search.user.js

Show status of ebook DRM in the search results for the popular online book
store [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/)

I do not buy products encumbered with Digital Rights Management (DRM). Some,
but not all, of the books at the Kobo online book store are sold without DRM.
When browsing or searching it's not possible to determine the DRM status of a
book without drilling down into the item's detail page. This makes the process
difficult and time-consuming.

A real solution for this would be for Kobo to add filtering for DRM status to
their search. In lieu of that, we can mark up the search results pages with the
DRM status of books. This user script does that for search results at Kobo.
